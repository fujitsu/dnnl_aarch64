# Deep Neural Network Library for AArch64 (DNNL_aarch64)

- An open-source performance library for deep learning applications running on ARM(R)v8-A architecture CPUs
- Optimized to ARMv8-A architecture with the Scalable Vector Extension (SVE)
- The key components are **Xbyak**, **Xbyak_aarch64**, and **Xbyak_Translator**
  - **Xbyak** :  A JIT-assembler for x86 and x64 architectures developed by Shigeo MITSUNARI (Cybozu Labs Inc.)
  - **Xbyak_aarch64** : A JIT-assembler for ARMv8-A architecture of Xbayk
  - **Xbyak_Translator** : A translator which generates JIT functions for ARMv8 with SVE from JIT functions for x86
- Developed based on version 0.21.2 of Deep Neural Network Library (DNNL) by Intel(R)



## Development status

DNNL_aarch64 generates two types of JIT functions using Xbyak, Xbyak_aarch64, and Xbyak_Translator for FP32 operations on ARMv8 with SVE processors

- One is to generate JIT functions for AArch64 directly using Xbyak_aarch64, which is called **Direct method**. The following operations are generated by the method.
  - Convolution
  - Reorder
- The other is a **JIT-translation** from JIT functions for x64 to JIT functions for AArch64 using Xbyak, Xbyak_aarch64, and Xbyak_Translator, which is called **Indirect method**. The following operations are generated by the method.
  - Batch normalization
  - Eltwise
  - Pooling
  - Concat
  - Softmax
  - Sum
  - RNN operations

Reference implementations by C++ run other than those above operations and unsupported parameter sets. They output correct result, but run somewhat slow.

**Bfloat16 support** : Currently, DNNL_aarch64 does not support

### Validated Configurations

| CPU          | Fujitsu FX1000 / 700                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **OS**       | RedHad 8.1 / Centos 8.1               |
| **Compiler** | Fujitsu compiler / GCC 8.3.1 20190507 |



## Requirements

Currently, DNNL_aarch64 is intended to run on CPUs of ARMv8-A with SVE. If you run DNNL_aarch64 on CPUs without SVE, it will be aborted because of undefined instruction exception. 



## Installation

1. Download DNNL_aarch64 from the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/fujitsu/dnnl_aarch64.git
```

2. Switch branch to **fjdev** from master and **update submodule**

```
cd dnnl_aarch64/
git checkout fjdev
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

3. Build xed library

```
mkdir third_party/build_xed_aarch64
pushd third_party/build_xed_aarch64/
../xbyak/translator/third_party/xed/mfile.py --shared examples install
cd kits/
ln -sf xed-install-base-* xed
popd
```

4. Build DNNN_aarch64

   - Using BLAS (Optional)

     1. Set the path to the BLAS library on your environment into `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
     2. Add the following options to cmake command

     | BLAS     | Option                                        |
     | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
     | SSL2     | -DWITH_BLAS=ssl2 (only with FUJITSU compiler) |
     | openblas | -DWITH_BLAS=openblas                          |

```
mkdir build_aarch64
cd build_aarch64/
cmake ..
make -j40
```

5. Test DNNL_aarch64 (optional)

```
cd tests/gtests
MKLDNN_VERBOSE=1 MKLDNN_JIT_DUMP=1 ./test_reorder
```
